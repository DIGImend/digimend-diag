DIGIMEND DIAG-WIZARD README

digimend-diag is a tool for gathering graphics tablet parameters and
behavior information. It supports USB HID tablets only currently.


PREREQUISITES

This program requires 2.6 series kernel.

In order to build and run this program you will need the following packages
installed along with their dependencies:

gawk
libusb-1.0-0-dev
usbutils


INSTALLATION

Traditional "./configure && make && make install" will do.


USAGE

Connect your tablet and run digimend-diag as a superuser, specifying output
file with the -o option, like this:

digimend-diag -o diag.txt

If it says "Tablet not found.", run lsusb and try to locate your tablet in
the output, then run digimend-diag again with the -i option specifying the
tablet's vendor and product IDs, like this:

digimend-diag -o diag.txt -i 5543:0005

Or you could simply specify a device name pattern with the -n option, like
this:

digimend-diag -o diag.txt -n '*Genius*'

You could get a full list of options with descriptions using the -h option.

During the diagnostics collection you will be asked to perform various input
actions. In order to eliminate any possibility of this input affecting your
environment, please make sure your X server (if you're running one) doesn't
react to your input, or switch to the console and make sure the gpm daemon
is not running.
