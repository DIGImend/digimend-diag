DIGIMEND-DIAG README

Digimend-diag is a tool for gathering graphics tablet parameters and
behavior information. It supports USB HID tablets only, currently.


PREREQUISITES

This program requires 2.6 series kernel.

In order to build and run this program you will need the following packages
installed along with their dependencies:

gawk
libhid-dev
usbutils


INSTALLATION

A simple "configure && make && make install" will do.


USAGE

Connect your tablet and run digimend-diag, specifying output file with the
-o option, like this:

digimend-diag -o diag.txt

If digimend-diag says "Tablet not found.", run lsusb and try to locate your
tablet in the output, then run digimend-diag again with the -i option
specifying the tablet's vendor and product IDs, like this:

digimend-diag -o diag.txt -i 5543:0005

Or you could simply specify a device name pattern with the -n option, like
this:

digimend-diag -o diag.txt -n '*Genius*'

You could get a full list of digimend-diag options with descriptions using
the -h option.
